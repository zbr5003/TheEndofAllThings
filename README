This will serve as the git repository for TheEndofAllThings.
If you are unfamiliar with git and github, I'll be able to provide some help (from email text, in person).

The first thing you are going to want to do to get access to this repository is create an account on github. After you do that, you'll be greeted with a page that will walk you through setting up everything and learning how to use it. This is how I learned how to use github and git. Again if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me.
